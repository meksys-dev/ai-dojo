# Dojo Documentation

Dojo is a Python CLI tool. This is a minimal scaffold project demonstrating a
standard Mekara version 0.1.0 project structure with best practices for Python
development.

a template for building Python CLI applications with modern tooling and
development practices.

## Key Features

- Modern Python packaging with `uv`
- Comprehensive pre-commit hooks (formatting, linting, type-checking)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- Standard Mekara project structure

Dojo is built as a standard Mekara version 0.1.0 project, incorporating
conventions and best practices for Python CLI development. It uses:

- **uv** for fast, reliable dependency management
- **ruff** for formatting and linting
- **mypy** for strict type checking
- **pytest** for testing
- **pre-commit** for automated quality checks
- **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration
